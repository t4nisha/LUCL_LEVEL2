This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for performing Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classification using machine learning techniques.

## Project Context

Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classification is crucial for understanding and managing natural resources, urban planning, and environmental monitoring. Accurate LULC classification helps in the assessment of ecosystem services, biodiversity conservation, and sustainable development. This project aims to implement a Level-2 LULC classification using various machine learning techniques. The approach leverages geospatial data processing and advanced classification algorithms to achieve detailed and accurate LULC mapping.

## Project Overview

The notebook utilizes libraries such as `rasterio`, `geopandas`, and `xgboost` to classify LULC at Level-2. The workflow includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Installation

To run the notebook, you need to install the required dependencies. You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
